            <p>
              One month ago Hurricane Helen hit our beloved Western North
              Carolina mountains and we have been reeling ever since. The storm
              wiped out our water supply, knocked out power in the region, and
              shut down internet and cell service. Worst of all have been the
              stories of lost lives and ruined homes and property. Our PAX are
              spread throughout the region, and as soon as comms came back
              online our guys were checking on each other, sharing resources,
              and making plans to serve. Some guys were displaced out of town,
              while others were low on gas and couldn’t get around, so the slack
              channels and text chains became a lifeline of support and
              encouragement. There are too many guys to shout out and stories to
              tell, but we wanted to recognize here some of the good that
              happened in the midst of such destruction.<p>
                In the pics below you will see F3 guys mucking out buildings
                (BRR guys might recognize Laurel Branch Baptist, home of the
                EZ30 pancake breakfast), reframing homes, pulling tractors out
                of rivers and fixing them up, moving PAX from damaged home,
                coordinating volunteers, and loading and unloading supplies. We
                are grateful for the guys down the road at F3 Waynesville for
                showing up strong for these cleanup efforts. Lots of our guys
                jumped in with local churches, ministries, and nonprofits to do
                anything we could to lend a hand.

            <h3 class="text-3xl lg:text-4xl">Help from Downrange</h3>
            <p>
              Even as our local PAX started to mobilize, F3 Nation reached out
              in mass to check on us and offer help. Among other places, we
              heard from F3 Charleston, Raleigh, and Wilmington who offered to
              send supplies and open their homes to displaced brothers. F3
              Waxhaw, under the leadership of Zinfandel, brought in two huge
              Ryder trucks full of supplies and unloaded at a local church for
              distribution. F3 Anderson joined the cause with Dingy and the guys
              raising funds to donate hundreds of 5-gallon water jugs. Solo PAX
              from Charlotte (Grizzly) and Sandhills (Squirrel) showed up with
              much needed supplies and aid. And the flow continues - we keep
              hearing from the Nation every day! As one of our guys said, “Other
              than our church, F3 has been the largest source of community and
              resources through this whole thing.”

            <p>
              The first phase of the disaster and recovery seems to be over, but
              we have a long road to rebuild much of WNC. Our guys are jumping
              in to serve where they can, and due to the vast scope of the
              recovery efforts, we have joined with some larger orgs. For those
              looking to give or serve, here are some groups our PAX are
              currently working with:
