            F3 is a men's fitness group. It's free: no catches. It's open to all
            men. The workouts aren't not led by professionals but instead by its
            members. Rain or shine. Hot or cold. Bright and early in the
            pre-dawn gloom.
          </p>
          <p class="text-xl">
            F3 is more than a boot camp workout. It's a chance for friendship.
            It's an opportunity for men to improve themselves -- through
            fitness, leadership, community service, and the strengthening of
            faith.

          <p class="text-xl">
            We hope you'll come join us in the morning gloom.

          The backbone of F3 is fitness. Each workout is led in rotation by a
          volunteer member of the group. The workouts' leaders (“Qs,” in F3
          lingo) offer any activities they wish as long as they can perform them
          themselves. As a result, F3 members are challenged and pushed in new
          ways every workout.
        </p>

        <p>
          The workouts can take any form, but most adhere to a 'boot camp' or
          'string of pearls' style workout. You do an exercise or set of
          exercises, run somewhere, rinse, repeat. Weekday workouts are 45
          minutes including a warmup at the beginning and a huddle-up 'Circle of
          Trust' at the end. Weekend workouts start later and last an hour.

      <div class="grid gap-4 px-4">
        <h3 class="text-3xl lg:text-4xl">Fellowship</h3>
        <p>
          Let's face it, for many men, it's hard to form the kind of friendships
          that they remember from high school or college. Do you have someone
          who would visit you if you're laid out with an injury? Do you know
          someone that could help you move? Do you have friends that would
          listen to a problem you're having and really want to help? Do you have
          friends you could do any of these things for?
        </p>
        <p>
          F3 is far from touchy-feely, but fellowship is important to us. Around
          the challenge and structure of F3, men form friendships. They are
          given the opportunity to help one another in the spirit of fellowship.
          We suffer together in the workouts. We serve together in group
          community service. Every workout ends with a chance for us to share
          something we need help with, something we're grieving over, or
          something we're celebrating.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="grid gap-4 px-4">
        <h3 class="text-3xl lg:text-4xl">Faith</h3>
        <p>
          Every workout ends with a Circle of Trust (CoT), and every CoT ends
          with a brief “shout-out” by that day's leader. They are free to pray
          to their god or to speak from a secular perspective — F3 is open to
          men of all faiths and no faith. The closing shout-out is generally the
          only faith-specific component of a workout. We do it because we are
          thankful for the opportunity to come together and build ourselves into
          better men. We do it because that gratitude's vocal and corporate
          expression builds a stronger F3 community.
        </p>
        <p>
          Try not to be weirded out by the expression of faith! We make a real
          effort to be inclusive to all men. No one is going to bug you to come
          to their church. We're not a cult. Faith is an important part of a lot
          of our lives. Maybe it is or could be a part of yours too. Or maybe
          not. We just ask that each of our members stand respectfully while the
          workout leader speaks their truth.
